# Day 1: Introduction to Solidity

-Understand what Solidity is and its importance in blockchain development

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript. You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.

Solidity is a powerful language that enables developers to create smart contracts and interact with the Ethereum network. It is a vital tool for building decentralized applications and implementing blockchain-based solutions.

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
